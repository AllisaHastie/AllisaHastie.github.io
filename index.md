Hi, my name is Allisa and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, working with Dr. Khalid Osman. My current work combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify challenges and develop solutions for water and wastewater systems in vulnerable U.S. communities. This work has fostered partnerships with community organizations and academic institutions nationwide, allowing me to leverage my technical expertise while continuously learning from the communities I engage with. 

Previously I completed a B.S. and M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working under Dr. Ashlynn Stillwell. I anticipate completeing my PhD in mid-2026.

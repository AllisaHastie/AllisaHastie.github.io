**Hello, my name is Allisa** and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, working with Dr. Khalid Osman. My current work combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify challenges and develop solutions for water and wastewater systems in vulnerable U.S. communities. This work has fostered partnerships with community organizations and academic institutions nationwide, allowing me to leverage my technical expertise while continuously learning from the communities I engage with. 

I anticipate completing my PhD in mid-2026.

**Previous Work:**

I completed a B.S. (2020) and M.S. (2022) in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working under Dr. Ashlynn Stillwell. My undergraduate research focused on analyzing the urban water-energy nexus using multi-resolution data combined from multiple sources. This work specifically utilized billing and utility data from a mid-sized midwestern city and was published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology special edition on Data Innovation in Industrial Ecology. You can view that work here:  [https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.1299](url)

During my Master's program I shifted my focus to non-potable water reuse in the U.S. exploring both technical and policy aspects. Using publically available data on wastewater treatment plans and industrial and agricultural water use, I conducted a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis to identify opporunities for non-potable reuse based on current state-level policy and _in situ_ wastewater treatment technologies. That work made up the bulk of my thesis and is published in ES&T Water ([https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00341](url)). A key component of that work was a survey of existing state-level water reuse policies, and what began as a side-project blossomed into a much larger qualitative and quantitative policy analysis, also published in ES&T Water ([https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00307](url))
